This is a repo to take notes for the course, [Algorithms Illuminated](http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/), from [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org/).

I write a step-by-step code here, and the code will be rough and not be over-optimized. So it might look concise, but hopefully it can be understandable with the note I took.
